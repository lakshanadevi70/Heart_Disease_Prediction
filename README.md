# Heart Disease Prediction ❤️🩺

## 📌 Project Overview
   This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical and health data. It helps classify patients into disease or no disease using patterns learned from a         labeled dataset. 

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
   -  Python
   -  Pandas & NumPy
   -  Scikit-learn (ML models)
   -  Matplotlib / Seaborn 

## 📈 Key Steps
   -  Load and clean the heart disease dataset
   -  Explore and preprocess data (handle missing values, feature scaling)
   -  Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
   -  Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix
   -  Use the trained model to predict if a person has heart disease 

## 📂 Dataset
  This project uses a heart disease dataset containing features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc. The target label tells whether a person has heart disease or not (binary    classification). 

## 🎯 Goal
   Understand and apply a machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation — for predicting health outcomes using real-world clinical data. 

## 📌 Learning Outcome
  -  Worked with real health datasets
  -  Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
  -  Built and evaluated classification models
  -  Interpreted model performance and results
